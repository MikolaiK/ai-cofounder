# Multi-Agent System

## Overview
The Multi-Agent System forms the operational core of the AI Co-founder framework, comprising specialized agents that collaborate to execute complex tasks across different domains and skill sets.

## Core Principles
- **Specialization** - Agents focus on specific domains or skillsets for optimal performance
- **Composition** - Complex tasks are broken down and distributed across multiple agents
- **Collaboration** - Agents communicate and coordinate to achieve shared objectives
- **Autonomy** - Agents operate independently within their domain of expertise
- **Adaptability** - System can dynamically allocate and configure agents based on task requirements

## Agent Types

### 1. Executive Agent
- **Purpose**: High-level planning, goal setting, and strategic decision-making
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Long-term strategic planning
  - Resource allocation and prioritization
  - Performance evaluation and optimization
  - Crisis management and risk assessment
- **Implementation**: Advanced reasoning LLM (e.g., GPT-4 or Claude 3 Opus) with system prompts optimized for executive functions

### 2. Research Agent
- **Purpose**: Information gathering, analysis, and synthesis
- **Capabilities**:
  - Web search and data collection
  - Information verification and fact-checking
  - Market and competitive analysis
  - Technology trend identification
- **Implementation**: LLM with web search tools, browser access, and data processing abilities

### 3. Development Agent
- **Purpose**: Software development and technical implementation
- **Capabilities**:
  - Code generation and review
  - System design and architecture
  - Testing and debugging
  - Technical documentation
- **Implementation**: Code-specialized LLM (e.g., Claude 3 Sonnet) with IDE integration and version control access

### 4. Content Agent
- **Purpose**: Content creation, editing, and management
- **Capabilities**:
  - Writing and editing various content types
  - Visual content creation guidance
  - Content strategy and planning
  - SEO optimization
- **Implementation**: Creative-focused LLM with multimodal capabilities

### 5. Operations Agent
- **Purpose**: Process execution, monitoring, and optimization
- **Capabilities**:
  - Workflow management
  - Performance monitoring
  - Resource optimization
  - Automation implementation
- **Implementation**: LLM with access to monitoring tools and operational dashboards

### 6. Customer Relations Agent
- **Purpose**: User interaction, feedback collection, and relationship management
- **Capabilities**:
  - Communication management
  - Feedback analysis
  - User experience assessment
  - Community engagement
- **Implementation**: Empathy-focused LLM with communication platform integrations

## Collaboration Framework

### 1. Communication Protocol
- Standardized message format for inter-agent communication
- Event-driven messaging system for asynchronous operations
- Secure and auditable communication channels

### 2. Task Distribution System
- Dynamic work allocation based on agent capabilities and load
- Task decomposition engine for breaking complex jobs into subtasks
- Priority management for resource optimization

### 3. Conflict Resolution Mechanism
- Decision arbitration when agents disagree
- Escalation pathways for human intervention
- Learning system to improve collaboration over time

### 4. Knowledge Sharing
- Shared memory access with appropriate permissions
- Expertise discovery to locate specialized knowledge
- Cross-agent learning for capability enhancement

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- Agent Foundation: FastAPI for agent services with asyncio
- Communication: Redis Pub/Sub for event distribution
- Orchestration: Celery or custom task queue for asynchronous execution
- Agent Containers: Docker for isolation and deployment flexibility
- API Gateway: Kong or similar for service routing and security

### Architecture Patterns
- Actor Model: Each agent is an independent actor with message-passing communication
- Blackboard Pattern: Shared knowledge repository for collaborative problem-solving
- Hierarchical Organization: Management structure for complex agent teams
- Dynamic Composition: Configurable agent teams assembled based on task requirements
