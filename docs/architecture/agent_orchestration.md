# Agent Orchestration System

## Overview
The Agent Orchestration System serves as the central nervous system of the AI Co-founder framework, coordinating the activities of all specialized agents and managing workflow execution.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Agent Lifecycle Management** - Creation, monitoring, and termination of agent instances
- **Task Distribution** - Delegating tasks to appropriate specialized agents
- **Workflow Execution** - Sequencing agent activities according to project plans
- **State Management** - Maintaining the global state of projects and tracking progress
- **Resource Allocation** - Optimizing the usage of computational resources across agents
- **Error Handling** - Managing failures and implementing recovery strategies

## Key Components

### 1. Agent Registry
- Maintains a catalog of all available agent types and their capabilities
- Stores metadata about agent configurations and dependencies
- Provides an API for querying agent availability and specifications

### 2. Workflow Engine
- Defines and executes workflows that coordinate multiple agents
- Supports parallel and sequential execution patterns
- Handles conditional branching and looping in workflows

### 3. State Manager
- Maintains a complete view of the system's state
- Persists state across system restarts
- Provides transactional updates to ensure consistency

### 4. Service Discovery
- Enables dynamic discovery of available agents and services
- Supports scaling by allowing multiple instances of the same agent type

### 5. Event Bus
- Facilitates asynchronous communication between agents
- Implements publish-subscribe patterns for event distribution
- Ensures events are delivered reliably with appropriate ordering

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies
- Core implementation: Python with FastAPI for high-performance async operations
- Event bus: Redis for pub/sub messaging
- State storage: PostgreSQL with JSONB columns for flexible state representation
- Service discovery: etcd or Consul

### Architecture Patterns
- Microservices: Each major component is implemented as a separate service
- Event-sourcing: System state is derived from a sequence of events
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): Separate models for updating and reading data
