# Advanced Memory System

## Overview
The Advanced Memory System is a multi-layered, hierarchical structure that provides the AI Co-founder with sophisticated reasoning capabilities and contextual awareness across different timescales and domains.

## Core Capabilities
- **Multi-modal Knowledge Storage** - Store and retrieve diverse types of information (text, code, images, structured data)
- **Contextual Retrieval** - Surface relevant information based on current context and project needs
- **Knowledge Integration** - Connect related information across different sources and time periods
- **Memory Consolidation** - Synthesize and compress information for long-term storage
- **Temporal Reasoning** - Understand and reason about sequences of events and causality
- **Forgetting Mechanisms** - Selectively deprecate outdated or irrelevant information

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Working Memory
- **Purpose**: Handles active task execution and immediate context
- **Characteristics**: High-capacity, high-speed, ephemeral storage
- **Technologies**: Redis, in-memory databases
- **Implementation**: Attention-based vectorized storage with recency bias

### 2. Episodic Memory
- **Purpose**: Stores chronological sequences of interactions and events
- **Characteristics**: Temporal organization, narrative structure
- **Technologies**: MongoDB with time-series capabilities
- **Implementation**: Sequential storage with timestamp indexing and contextual markers

### 3. Semantic Memory
- **Purpose**: Represents factual knowledge and concept relationships
- **Characteristics**: Knowledge graph structure, conceptual organization
- **Technologies**: Neo4j or dedicated vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate)
- **Implementation**: Entity-relationship modeling with vector embeddings

### 4. Procedural Memory
- **Purpose**: Encodes workflows, processes, and execution patterns
- **Characteristics**: Reusable sequences, optimization over time
- **Technologies**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible workflow definitions
- **Implementation**: Stored procedures and workflow templates with versioning

## Integration Components

### 1. Memory Manager
- Coordinates data flow between memory layers
- Implements consolidation processes between short and long-term storage
- Manages memory lifecycle (creation, access, update, deprecation)

### 2. Knowledge Graph Engine
- Builds and maintains semantic relationships between entities
- Provides graph traversal and query capabilities
- Identifies patterns and insights across the knowledge base

### 3. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) System
- Uses vector similarity to retrieve relevant context for agent decision-making
- Implements hybrid retrieval strategies (keyword, semantic, structural)
- Reranks retrieved information based on relevance and utility

### 4. Memory Consolidation Service
- Periodically analyzes and summarizes information across memory layers
- Identifies key insights and patterns for long-term storage
- Removes redundancies and resolves contradictions

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- Vector Embeddings: OpenAI embeddings API or open-source alternatives (e.g., Sentence Transformers)
- Vector Database: Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant for semantic search
- Graph Database: Neo4j for knowledge graph representation
- Document Database: MongoDB for episodic storage
- Cache Layer: Redis for working memory

### Architecture Patterns
- Hybrid search combining vector similarity and symbolic methods
- Multi-stage retrieval with iterative refinement
- Event-sourcing for maintaining historical progression
- Hierarchical compression for efficient long-term storage
